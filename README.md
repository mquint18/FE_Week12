Create a CRD application (CRUD without update) using json-server or another API
Use fetch and async/await to interact with the API
Use a form to create/post new entities
Build a way for users to delete entities
Include a way to get entities from the API and display them
You do NOT need update, but you can add it if you'd like
Use Bootstrap and/or CSS to style your project


I used a guide I found online to help with this project. 

Although the edit/update feature works, the html page doesn't update until you refresh the page.
